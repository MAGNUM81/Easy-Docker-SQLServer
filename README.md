# Easy-Docker-SQLServer

## What is it?
This tool targets a very specific audience that have wrecked their SQL Server installation on their Windows PC and don't want to fix it. It is basically a Powershell script that will build and create a docker container for you containing all the databases you had in the state they were when you broke you SQL Server instance(s) or installation. 
### Disclaimer
This tool is not meant for production purposes.

## What are the prerequisites?
 - Windows 10 environment (This was never tested on older versions, but be cool and upgrade if you didn't already)
 - Some Docker for Desktop flavor installed on the machine
 - Back-up files for unaccessible databases (.ldf and .mdf files)
 - Powershell 2.0+
 - SSMS 2014 and up
